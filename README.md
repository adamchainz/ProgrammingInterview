## Contributing

If you wish to submit a missing solution or improvement, just change the file,
or add it in the same pattern as the others. Each file is self-contained with
the unit tests that check it.

To run the tests, you'll need tox:

    pip install tox

Then, you can run them on both python 2.7 and 3.4 in one command:

    tox
