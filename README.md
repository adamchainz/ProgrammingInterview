# ProgrammingInterview

Solving the questions shown in the videos on the
[ProgrammingInterview](http://www.youtube.com/user/ProgrammingInterview/videos)
YouTube channel in Python - writing tests first! Some might wonder why I write
my tests in a separate file - it's purely for productivity reasons. I have my
editor open in split mode so I can see the code on the left and the tests on
the right whilst I'm working.


Enjoy!
